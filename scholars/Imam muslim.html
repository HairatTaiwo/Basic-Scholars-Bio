        <p>Muslim is considered second only to <b>Al-Bukhari</b> in the science of the methodology of Hadeeth.
            He started the study of Hadeeth at an early age and travelled to <em>Hijaz, Ash-Sham and Egypt</em> and studied under the scholars 
            of Hadeeth at that time like <b>Al-Bukhari, Ahmad bin Hanbal and Ibn Abee Shaiba</b>. Muslim compiled the Hadeeth book Al-Musnad As-Sahih 
            which became known as <em>Sahih Muslim</em>. Imam Muslim died at his birth place in Rajab 261H.
